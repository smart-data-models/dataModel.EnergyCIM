## List of properties  

- `LoadDynamics`: Load dynamics model used to describe dynamic behavior of this energy consumer. Default: None  - `LoadResponse`: The load response characteristic of this load.  If missing, this load is assumed to be constant power. Default: None  - `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `location`:   - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `p`: Active power of the load. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node. For voltage dependent loads the value is at rated voltage. Starting value for a steady state solution. Default: 0.0  - `pfixed`: Active power of the load that is a fixed quantity. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node. Default: 0.0  - `pfixedPct`: Fixed active power as per cent of load group fixed active power. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node. Default: 0.0  - `q`: Reactive power of the load. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node. For voltage dependent loads the value is at rated voltage. Starting value for a steady state solution. Default: 0.0  - `qfixed`: Reactive power of the load that is a fixed quantity. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node. Default: 0.0  - `qfixedPct`: Fixed reactive power as per cent of load group fixed reactive power. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node. Default: 0.0  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be EnergyConsumer
