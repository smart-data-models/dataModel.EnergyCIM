## List of properties  

- `ReactiveCapabilityCurve`: The equivalent injection using this reactive capability curve. Default: None  - `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `location`:   - `maxP`: Maximum active power of the injection. Default: 0.0  - `maxQ`: Used for modeling of infeed for load flow exchange. Not used for short circuit modeling.  If maxQ and minQ are not used ReactiveCapabilityCurve can be used. Default: 0.0  - `minP`: Minimum active power of the injection. Default: 0.0  - `minQ`: Used for modeling of infeed for load flow exchange. Not used for short circuit modeling.  If maxQ and minQ are not used ReactiveCapabilityCurve can be used. Default: 0.0  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `p`: Equivalent active power injection. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node. Starting value for steady state solutions. Default: 0.0  - `q`: Equivalent reactive power injection. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node. Starting value for steady state solutions. Default: 0.0  - `r`: Positive sequence resistance. Used to represent Extended-Ward (IEC 60909). Usage : Extended-Ward is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange. Default: 0.0  - `r0`: Zero sequence resistance. Used to represent Extended-Ward (IEC 60909). Usage : Extended-Ward is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange. Default: 0.0  - `r2`: Negative sequence resistance. Used to represent Extended-Ward (IEC 60909). Usage : Extended-Ward is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange. Default: 0.0  - `regulationCapability`: Specifies whether or not the EquivalentInjection has the capability to regulate the local voltage. Default: False  - `regulationStatus`: Specifies the default regulation status of the EquivalentInjection.  True is regulating.  False is not regulating. Default: False  - `regulationTarget`: The target voltage for voltage regulation. Default: 0.0  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be EquivalentInjection  - `x`: Positive sequence reactance. Used to represent Extended-Ward (IEC 60909). Usage : Extended-Ward is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange. Default: 0.0  - `x0`: Zero sequence reactance. Used to represent Extended-Ward (IEC 60909). Usage : Extended-Ward is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange. Default: 0.0  - `x2`: Negative sequence reactance. Used to represent Extended-Ward (IEC 60909). Usage : Extended-Ward is a result of network reduction prior to the data exchange. Default: 0.0    
Required properties  
Adapted from CIM data models and CIMpy - [https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy](https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy). This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. Some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, please raise an issue or send mail to info@smartdatamodels.org.
