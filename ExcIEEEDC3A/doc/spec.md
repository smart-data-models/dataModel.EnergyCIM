Entity: ExcIEEEDC3A  
===================  
[Open License](https://github.com/smart-data-models//dataModel.EnergyCIM/blob/master/ExcIEEEDC3A/LICENSE.md)  
Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type DC3A model. This model represents represent older systems, in particular those dc commutator exciters with non-continuously acting regulators that were commonly used before the development of the continuously acting varieties.  These systems respond at basically two different rates, depending upon the magnitude of voltage error. For small errors, adjustment is made periodically with a signal to a motor-operated rheostat. Larger errors cause resistors to be quickly shorted or inserted and a strong forcing signal applied to the exciter. Continuous motion of the motor-operated rheostat occurs for these larger error signals, even though it is bypassed by contactor action.   Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 5.3.**  

## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address.  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `efd1`: Exciter voltage at which exciter saturation is defined (E).  Typical Value = 3.375. Default: 0.0  - `efd2`: Exciter voltage at which exciter saturation is defined (E).  Typical Value = 3.15. Default: 0.0  - `exclim`: (exclim).  IEEE standard is ambiguous about lower limit on exciter output. true = a lower limit of zero is applied to integrator output false = a lower limit of zero is not applied to integrator output. Typical Value = true. Default: False  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `ke`: Exciter constant related to self-excited field (K).  Typical Value = 0.05. Default: 0.0  - `kv`: Fast raise/lower contact setting (K).  Typical Value = 0.05. Default: 0.0  - `location`:   - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `seefd1`: Exciter saturation function value at the corresponding exciter voltage, E (S[E]).  Typical Value = 0.267. Default: 0.0  - `seefd2`: Exciter saturation function value at the corresponding exciter voltage, E (S[E]).  Typical Value = 0.068. Default: 0.0  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `te`: Exciter time constant, integration rate associated with exciter control (T).  Typical Value = 0.5. Default: 0  - `trh`: Rheostat travel time (T).  Typical Value = 20. Default: 0  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be ExcIEEEDC3A  - `vrmax`: Maximum voltage regulator output (V).  Typical Value = 1. Default: 0.0  - `vrmin`: Minimum voltage regulator output (V).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0    
Required properties  
This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, pelase raise an issue or send mail to alberto.abella@fiware.org
