Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. The class models a look up table for the purpose of wind standard models.**  

## List of properties  

- `WindContCurrLimIEC`: The wind dynamics lookup table associated with this current control limitation model. Default: None  - `WindContPType3IEC`: The wind dynamics lookup table associated with this P control type 3 model. Default: None  - `WindContRotorRIEC`: The rotor resistance control model with which this wind dynamics lookup table is associated. Default: None  - `WindPlantFreqPcontrolIEC`: The wind dynamics lookup table associated with this frequency and active power wind plant model. Default: None  - `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `input`: Input value (x) for the lookup table function. Default: 0.0  - `location`:   - `lookupTableFunctionType`: Type of the lookup table function. Default: None  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `output`: Output value (y) for the lookup table function. Default: 0.0  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `sequence`: Sequence numbers of the pairs of the input (x) and the output (y) of the lookup table function. Default: 0  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be WindDynamicsLookupTable    
Required properties  
This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, pelase raise an issue or send mail to alberto.abella@fiware.org
