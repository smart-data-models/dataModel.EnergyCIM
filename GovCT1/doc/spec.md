## List of properties  

<sup><sub>[*] If there is not a type in an attribute is because it could have several types or different formats/patterns</sub></sup>  
- `address[object]`: The mailing address  . Model: [https://schema.org/address](https://schema.org/address)- `alternateName[string]`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed[string]`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  . Model: [https://schema.org/Text](https://schema.org/Text)- `aset[number]`: Acceleration limiter setpoint (Aset).  Unit = PU/sec.  Typical Value = 0.01. Default: 0.0  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `dataProvider[string]`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated[string]`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified[string]`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `db[number]`: Speed governor dead band in per unit speed (db).  In the majority of applications, it is recommended that this value be set to zero.  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `description[string]`: A description of this item  - `dm[number]`: Speed sensitivity coefficient (Dm).  Dm can represent either the variation of the engine power with the shaft speed or the variation of maximum power capability with shaft speed.  If it is positive it describes the falling slope of the engine speed verses power characteristic as speed increases. A slightly falling characteristic is typical for reciprocating engines and some aero-derivative turbines.  If it is negative the engine power is assumed to be unaffected by the shaft speed, but the maximum permissible fuel flow is taken to fall with falling shaft speed. This is characteristic of single-shaft industrial turbines due to exhaust temperature limits.  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0  .

Typical Value = 0.04. Default: 0.0  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `rclose[number]`: Minimum valve closing rate (Rclose).  Unit = PU/sec.  Typical Value = -0.1. Default: 0.0  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `rdown[number]`: Maximum rate of load limit decrease (Rdown).  Typical Value = -99. Default: 0.0  .
