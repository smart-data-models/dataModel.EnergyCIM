Dm can represent either the variation of the engine power with the shaft speed or the variation of maximum power capability with shaft speed.

A slightly falling characteristic is typical for reciprocating engines and some aero-derivative turbines.  If it is negative the engine power is assumed to be unaffected by the shaft speed, but the maximum permissible fuel flow is taken to fall with falling shaft speed.
