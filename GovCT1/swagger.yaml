    Adapted from CIM data models. General model for any prime mover with a PID governor, used primarily for combustion turbine and combined cycle units. This model can be used to represent a variety of prime movers controlled by PID governors.  It is suitable, for example, for representation of     Additional information on this model is available in the 2012 IEEE report, , section 3.1.2.3 page 3-4 (GGOV1).
