## List of properties  

- `WindDynamicsLookupTable`: The current control limitation model with which this wind dynamics lookup table is associated. Default: 'list'  - `WindTurbineType3or4IEC`: Wind turbine type 3 or 4 model with which this wind control current limitation model is associated. Default: None  - `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `imax`: Maximum continuous current at the wind turbine terminals (). It is type dependent parameter. Default: 0.0  - `imaxdip`: Maximum current during voltage dip at the wind turbine terminals (). It is project dependent parameter. Default: 0.0  - `location`:   - `mdfslim`: Limitation of type 3 stator current  ():  - false=0: total current limitation,  - true=1: stator current limitation).  It is type dependent parameter. Default: False  - `mqpri`: Prioritisation of q control during LVRT (): - true = 1: reactive power priority, - false = 0: active power priority.  It is project dependent parameter. Default: False  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `tufilt`: Voltage measurement filter time constant (). It is type dependent parameter. Default: 0  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be WindContCurrLimIEC    
Required properties  
This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, pelase raise an issue or send mail to alberto.abella@fiware.org
