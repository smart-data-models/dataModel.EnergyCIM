    "description": "Adapted from CIM data models. Used to apply user standard names to topology buses. Typically used for bus/branch case generation. Associated with one or more terminals that are normally connected with the bus name. The associated terminals are normally connected by non-retained switches. For a ring bus station configuration, all busbar terminals in the ring are typically associated. For a breaker and a half scheme, both busbars would normally be associated.  For a ring bus, all busbars would normally be associated.  For a 'straight' busbar configuration, normally only the main terminal at the busbar would be associated.",
