    "description": "Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type DC1A model. This model represents field-controlled dc commutator exciters with continuously acting voltage regulators (especially the direct-acting rheostatic, rotating amplifier, and magnetic amplifier types).  Because this model has been widely implemented by the industry, it is sometimes used to represent other types of systems when detailed data for them are not available or when a simplified model is required.   Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 5.1.",
