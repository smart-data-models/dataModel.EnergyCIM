## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `efdmax`: Maximum open circuit exciter voltage (Efdmax).  Typical Value = 5. Default: 0.0  - `efdmin`: Minimum open circuit exciter voltage (Efdmin).  Typical Value = -5. Default: 0.0  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `k`: Steady state gain (K).  Typical Value = 300. Default: 0.0  - `location`:   - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `switch`: Supplementary signal routing selector (switch). true = Vs connected to 3rd summing point false =  Vs connected to 1st summing point (see diagram). Typical Value = true. Default: False  - `t1`: Controller time constant (T1).  Typical Value = 6. Default: 0  - `t2`: Controller time constant (T2).  Typical Value = 1. Default: 0  - `t3`: Lead/lag time constant (T3).  Typical Value = 0.05. Default: 0  - `t4`: Lead/lag time constant (T4).  Typical Value = 0.01. Default: 0  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be ExcBBC  - `vrmax`: Maximum control element output (Vrmax).  Typical Value = 5. Default: 0.0  - `vrmin`: Minimum control element output (Vrmin).  Typical Value = -5. Default: 0.0  - `xe`: Effective excitation transformer reactance (Xe).  Typical Value = 0.05. Default: 0.0
