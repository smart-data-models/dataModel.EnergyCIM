## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `location`:   - `name`: The name of this item.  - `negativeR12`: Negative sequence series resistance from terminal sequence  1 to terminal sequence 2.

Required properties  
Adapted from CIM data models and CIMpy - [https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy](https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy). This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. Some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, please raise an issue or send mail to info@smartdatamodels.org.

## Example payloads    
Not available the example of a EquivalentBranch in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.  
Not available the example of a EquivalentBranch in JSON-LD format as normalized. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when not using options and returns the context data of an individual entity.
