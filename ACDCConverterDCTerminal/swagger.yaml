    Adapted from CIM data models. A DC electrical connection point at the AC/DC converter. The AC/DC converter is electrically connected also to the AC side. The AC connection is inherited from the AC conducting equipment in the same way as any other AC equipment. The AC/DC converter DC terminal is separate from generic DC terminal to restrict the connection with the AC side to AC/DC converter and so that no other DC conducting equipment can be connected to the AC side.
