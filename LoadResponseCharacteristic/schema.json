This is not related to demand response.  If LoadResponseCharacteristic.exponentModel is True, the voltage exponents are specified and used as to calculate:  Active power component = Pnominal * (Voltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage) ** cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.pVoltageExponent  Reactive power component = Qnominal * (Voltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage)** cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.qVoltageExponent  Where  * means 'multiply' and ** is 'raised to power of'.",
