Entity: LoadResponseCharacteristic  
==================================  
[Open License](https://github.com/smart-data-models//dataModel.EnergyCIM/blob/master/LoadResponseCharacteristic/LICENSE.md)  
Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. Models the characteristic response of the load demand due to changes in system conditions such as voltage and frequency. This is not related to demand response.  If LoadResponseCharacteristic.exponentModel is True, the voltage exponents are specified and used as to calculate:  Active power component = Pnominal * (Voltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage) ** cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.pVoltageExponent  Reactive power component = Qnominal * (Voltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage)** cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.qVoltageExponent  Where  * means 'multiply' and ** is 'raised to power of'.**  

## List of properties  

- `EnergyConsumer`: The set of loads that have the response characteristics. Default: 'list'  - `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `exponentModel`: Indicates the exponential voltage dependency model is to be used.   If false, the coefficient model is to be used. The exponential voltage dependency model consist of the attributes - pVoltageExponent - qVoltageExponent. The coefficient model consist of the attributes - pConstantImpedance - pConstantCurrent - pConstantPower - qConstantImpedance - qConstantCurrent - qConstantPower. The sum of pConstantImpedance, pConstantCurrent and pConstantPower shall equal 1. The sum of qConstantImpedance, qConstantCurrent and qConstantPower shall equal 1. Default: False  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `location`:   - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `pConstantCurrent`: Portion of active power load modeled as constant current. Default: 0.0  - `pConstantImpedance`: Portion of active power load modeled as constant impedance. Default: 0.0  - `pConstantPower`: Portion of active power load modeled as constant power. Default: 0.0  - `pFrequencyExponent`: Exponent of per unit frequency effecting active power. Default: 0.0  - `pVoltageExponent`: Exponent of per unit voltage effecting real power. Default: 0.0  - `qConstantCurrent`: Portion of reactive power load modeled as constant current. Default: 0.0  - `qConstantImpedance`: Portion of reactive power load modeled as constant impedance. Default: 0.0  - `qConstantPower`: Portion of reactive power load modeled as constant power. Default: 0.0  - `qFrequencyExponent`: Exponent of per unit frequency effecting reactive power. Default: 0.0  - `qVoltageExponent`: Exponent of per unit voltage effecting reactive power. Default: 0.0  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be LoadResponseCharacteristic    
Required properties  
This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, pelase raise an issue or send mail to alberto.abella@fiware.org
