- `address`: The mailing address.  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `governorSCD`: Power Frequency Bias.

Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node. Starting value for steady state solutions. Default: 0.0  - `referencePriority`: Priority of unit for use as powerflow voltage phase angle reference bus selection. 0 = don t care (default) 1 = highest priority. 2 is less than 1 and so on. Default: 0  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be ExternalNetworkInjection  - `voltageFactor`: Voltage factor in pu, which was used to calculate short-circuit current Ik` and power Sk`. Default: 0.0    
Required properties  
This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, pelase raise an issue or send mail to alberto.abella@fiware.org

## Example payloads    
#### ExternalNetworkInjection NGSI V2 key-values Example    
Here is an example of a ExternalNetworkInjection in JSON format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI V2 when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.  
#### ExternalNetworkInjection NGSI V2 normalized Example    
Here is an example of a ExternalNetworkInjection in JSON format as normalized. This is compatible with NGSI V2 when not using options and returns the context data of an individual entity.  
#### ExternalNetworkInjection NGSI-LD key-values Example    
Here is an example of a ExternalNetworkInjection in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-LD when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.  
#### ExternalNetworkInjection NGSI-LD normalized Example
