Required properties  
This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, pelase raise an issue or send mail to alberto.abella@fiware.org
