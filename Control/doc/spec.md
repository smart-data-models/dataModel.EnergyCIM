Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. Control is used for supervisory/device control. It represents control outputs that are used to change the state in a process, e.g. close or open breaker, a set point value or a raise lower command.**  

## List of properties  

- `PowerSystemResource`: The controller outputs used to actually govern a regulating device, e.g. the magnetization of a synchronous machine or capacitor bank breaker actuator. Default: None  - `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `controlType`: Specifies the type of Control, e.g. BreakerOn/Off, GeneratorVoltageSetPoint, TieLineFlow etc. The ControlType.name shall be unique among all specified types and describe the type. Default: ''  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `location`:   - `name`: The name of this item.  - `operationInProgress`: Indicates that a client is currently sending control commands that has not completed. Default: False  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `timeStamp`: The last time a control output was sent. Default: ''  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be Control  - `unitMultiplier`: The unit multiplier of the controlled quantity. Default: None  - `unitSymbol`: The unit of measure of the controlled quantity. Default: None
