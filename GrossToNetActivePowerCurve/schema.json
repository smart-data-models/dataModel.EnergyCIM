Relationship between the generating unit's gross active power output on the X-axis (measured at the terminals of the machine(s)) and the generating unit's net active power output on the Y-axis (based on utility-defined measurements at the power station). Station service loads, when modeled, should be treated as non-conforming bus loads. There may be more than one curve, depending on the auxiliary equipment that is in service.",
