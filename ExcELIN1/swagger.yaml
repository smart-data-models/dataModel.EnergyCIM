    Adapted from CIM data models. Static PI transformer fed excitation system: ELIN (VATECH) - simplified model.  This model represents an all-static excitation system. A PI voltage controller establishes a desired field current set point for a proportional current controller. The integrator of the PI controller has a follow-up input to match its signal to the present field current.  A power system stabilizer with power input is included in the model.
